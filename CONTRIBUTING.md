# Temporary contributing file, will be expanded at a later date

Contributing is very loose and open, however, please make sure to test any changes before opening a PR.

### Code Style
PyMultibound uses camelCase rather than Python's preferred snake_case because PyQt5 (as a Qt binding) uses camelCase, and consistency is more important than any specific code style.

Also, if possible, please document any functions you add. It doesn't have to be in any official format, as long as it clearly explains what the function does.
